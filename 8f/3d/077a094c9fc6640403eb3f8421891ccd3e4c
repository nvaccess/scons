  This release adds several new features and fixes many issues.

  Here is a summary of the changes since 2.2:

  NEW FUNCTIONALITY

    - Versioned shared library support for Linux and Mac:
      Add SHLIBVERSION as an option that tells SharedLibrary to build
      a versioned shared library and create the required symlinks.
      Add builder InstallVersionedLib to create the required symlinks
      installing a versioned shared library.

  DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY

    - Removed a lot of Python 2.3 and older support code
    - Hide deprecated --debug={dtree,stree,tree} from --help output

  CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

    - No changes

  FIXES

    - Fix subprocess spawning on Windows.  Work around a Windows
      bug that can crash python occasionally when using -jN. (#2449)
    - Fix nested LIBPATH expansion by flattening sequences in subst_path.
    - Fix WiX Tool to use .wixobj rather than .wxiobj for compiler output
    - Add MSVC10 and MSVC11 support to get_output low-level bat script runner.

  IMPROVEMENTS

    - Error messages from option parser now include hints about valid choices
    - Support building with WiX releases after 2.0

    - Updated the TeX builder to support the \newglossary command
